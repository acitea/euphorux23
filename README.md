#### End Notes

This is the first and only camp that I know which has integrated a website into its operations, participation and functioning. This is the product of many weeks of development by one amateur developer, collaboration with the programmes & marketing department and feedback from Facilitators themselves to get this up and running smoothly & usefully. Know that whilst building this, there are LOTS of "spaghetti code" which could definitely be refactored to be better, and MORE features that could be great to have like the following:

1. A photowall page where users can upload a photo with captions & timestamp to share "What's happening now"
2. A horizontally rolling sponsors list on the landing page
3. Another tab in the scoreboard page to show overall clan scores
4. A nicer gallery implementation, possibly using masonry
5. Better visual cues for the attendance list
6. Improvements to UI & Design for the OCs
7. Better UAT...

But alas, the priority is to get the main functions working! I will leave it up to any future batches who may be interested :)

Thank you to all those during Euphorux 2023 that used the website as it means that it has served its purpose well. Special thanks to those that encouraged the development, despite some traction. Feel free to contact me :D
